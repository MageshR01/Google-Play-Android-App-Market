Mobile apps are everywhere. They are easy to create and can be lucrative. Because of these two factors, 
more and more apps are being developed. In this project, we will do a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market
by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories. We'll look for insights in the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention.
The process is listed below
1. Data cleaning 

2. Correcting data types
From the previous task we noticed that Installs and Price were categorized as object data type (and not int or float) as we would like. 
This is because these two columns originally had mixed input types: digits and special characters. To know more about Pandas data types

3. Exploring app categories
With more than 1 billion active users in 190 countries around the world, Google Play continues to be an important distribution platform to build a global audience.
For businesses to get their apps in front of users, it's important to make them more quickly and easily discoverable on Google Play.
To improve the overall search experience, Google has introduced the concept of grouping apps into categories.

4. Distribution of app ratings
After having witnessed the market share for each category of apps, let's see how all these apps perform on an average.
App ratings (on a scale of 1 to 5) impact the discoverability, conversion of apps as well as the company's overall brand image. Ratings are a key performance indicator of an app.

5. Size and price of an app
Let's now examine app size and app price. For size, if the mobile app is too large, it may be difficult and/or expensive for users to download. 
Lengthy download times could turn users off before they even experience your mobile app. Plus, each user's device has a finite amount of disk space. 
For price, some users expect their apps to be free or inexpensive. 
These problems compound if the developing world is part of your target market; especially due to internet speeds, earning power and exchange rates.

6. Relation between app category and app price
So now comes the hard part. 
How are companies and developers supposed to make ends meet? What monetization strategies can companies use to maximize profit? The costs of apps are largely based on features, complexity,
and platform.

7. Filter out "junk" apps
It looks like a bunch of the really expensive apps are "junk" apps. 
That is, apps that don't really have a purpose. Some app developer may create an app called I Am Rich Premium or most expensive app (H) 
just for a joke or to test their app development skills. Some developers even do this with malicious intent and try to make money by hoping people accidentally click purchase on 
their app in the store.

8. Popularity of paid apps vs free apps
For apps in the Play Store today, there are five types of pricing strategies: free, freemium, paid, paymium, and subscription. 
Let's focus on free and paid apps only. Some characteristics of free apps are:

Free to download.
Main source of income often comes from advertisements.
Often created by companies that have other products and the app serves as an extension of those products.
Can serve as a tool for customer retention, communication, and customer service.

19. Sentiment analysis of user reviews
Mining user review data to determine how people feel about your product, brand, or service can be done using a technique called sentiment analysis. 
User reviews for apps can be analyzed to identify if the mood is positive, negative or neutral about that app. 
For example, positive words in an app review might include words such as 'amazing', 'friendly', 'good', 'great', and 'love'. Negative words might be words like 
'malware', 'hate', 'problem', 'refund', and 'incompetent'.

By plotting sentiment polarity scores of user reviews for paid and free apps, we observe that free apps receive a lot of harsh comments, 
as indicated by the outliers on the negative y-axis. Reviews for paid apps appear never to be extremely negative. This may indicate something about app quality, 
i.e., paid apps being of higher quality than free apps on average. The median polarity score for paid apps is a little higher than free apps, 
thereby syncing with our previous observation.

we analyzed over ten thousand apps from the Google Play Store. We can use our findings to inform our decisions.
